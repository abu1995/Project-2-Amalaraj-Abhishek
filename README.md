ABHISHEK AMALARAJ IS 542 
PROJECT 2

I learned a lot from Project 2 especially to do with dynamic use of functions and the use of ajax and fetch apis and how the html links get grabbed from the server. Overall, it was a very well rounded experience.
Also customizing the CSS in this project was a learning curve, seeing how they were connected. There is a lot of information which was being processed at a very quick pace which looked impressive as I have not had much programming experience in the past. The concept of animations was quite intriquing.

I used functions in navigateScriptures and getscripturesCallback and used them to create the animation slide effect in the project. The fadeIn and fadeOut operations proved to be quite a challenge but then I used the setTimeout function to carry out this task.

As part of the assignment, I asked for feedback from a few friends on the website and they me some input on the styling and colors and the way the website looked on their phones. I implemented them in the Project 2.
Thank you for assigning this project to us to work on. I am grateful that I got to learn so much in this class.
